# Stuck

Stuck is an esoteric, stack-based programming language intended for code-golf. It was inspired by many languages, such as CJam, GolfScript and Pyth. It is interpreted in Python, and it is very easy to translate Python code to the equivalent Stuck code.

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/kade-robertson/stuck).

There is some barebones documentation available on the [Esolangs page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Stuck).
